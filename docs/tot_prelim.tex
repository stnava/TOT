We processed the images using ANTs tools to segment deep gray matter,
CSF, white matter and cortical volume.   These measurements, for each
individual, were merged with demographics prepared by Laura
Betancourt. Jue Wu performed the image processing.  

We tested the full model with all covariates to determine whether
tissue volumes are related to the Adjusted HOME variable in the
presence of covariates accounting for gestational age, maternal age at
delivery and maternal BMI at delivery.

The results suggest that cortical volume is significantly related to
the HOME measurement.  Furthermore, HOME scores can be accuately
predicted by this collection of variables as shown in the
cross-validation study summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:fig1}.  This
suggests that the full model is not overfitting.  These results are
suprising given the small sample size.  One potential interpretation (if
results hold) is in line with our other HOME paper: variations within
low-SES homes directly impact brain development.  Normal variability within resource-starved environments may lead to
long-term consequences on outcome, potentially through early impact on
neural architecture.
